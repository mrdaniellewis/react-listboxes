# Combo box with background autocomplete

This demonstrates the search working like the autocomplete on the Google Mail search bar.

Try typing `on:` or `is:` for example.

Pressing tab will complete the suggestion.  A disabled 'ghost' input is placed behind the main input to
show the autocomplete suggestion.

> :warning: **Warning** the search suggestions are not accessible to a screen reader.
>
> Potentially using `autoselect="inline"` could resolve this.
